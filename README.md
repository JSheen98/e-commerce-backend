# E-Commerce Backend

## ‚úèÔ∏è Description:

With this project I wanted to create a backend database for an e-commerce company. This database features four tables including: Categories, Products, Tags, and Product-Tags. Several of these tables include associations to share relevant data with each other. These tables also include several methods that include Get/Post/Put and Delete, which allows the user to see the data, create new data, update data, and delete data from the tables. This information should be easily accessible through a backend app such as Insomnia, Postman, etc.
